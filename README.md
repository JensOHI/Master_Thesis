# Setting up MATLAB
Programs and packages (I have install to make it run):

When opening the simulink file [scene.slx](MATLAB/scene.slx) go to MODELLING > Mode Explorer > scene > Model Workspace, then press browse and make sure [scene_parameters.m](MATLAB/scene_parameters.m) is chosen and finally press "Reinitalize from Source".
